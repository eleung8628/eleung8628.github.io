			<h1>Bee Movie</h1>
			<div class="subtitle">
				<p>
				<em>Bee Movie</em> is a 2007 American computer-animated comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation 
				and Columbus 81 Productions, and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film was directed 
				by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner (in the former's feature directorial debut) from a 
				screenplay by Jerry Seinfeld, Spike Feresten, Barry Marder and Andy Robin. It stars the 
				voices of Seinfeld, Renée Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, 
				and Chris Rock. The film centers on Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld), a honey bee who tries to 
				sue the human race for exploiting bees after learning from his new florist friend Vanessa 
				Bloome (Zellweger) that humans sell and consume honey.<br>
				<em>Bee Movie</em> debuted in New York City on October 25, 2007, and was released in theaters in the 
				United States on November 2. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its humor and 
				voice cast, but criticized its plot and lack of originality. The film was a box office success, 
				grossing $293.5 million worldwide on a budget of $150 million. It has since gathered a cult 
				following, partly driven by memes of the film shared on social media, which most often poke fun 
				at the film's premise, script and celebrity cameos.

			website Rotten Tomatoes, with an <span class="stats">average rating of 5.6/10</span>. Its critical consensus reads, "<em>Bee Movie</em> 
			has humorous moments, but its awkward premise and tame delivery render it mostly forgettable."

			Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "It's 
			on the easygoing level of Surf's Up, and a full tick up from, say, Over the Hedge or The Ant Bully. 
			But given the Seinfeld pedigree it's something of a disappointment." Peter Travers of Rolling 
			Stone gave the film three out of four stars, saying "At its relaxed best, when it's about, well, 
			nothing, the slyly comic <em>Bee Movie</em> is truly beguiling." Desson Thomson of The Washington Post said,
			"<em>Bee Movie</em> feels phoned in on every level. The images, usually computer animation's biggest draw, are 
			disappointingly average. And as for the funny stuff, well, that's where you were supposed to come in."
			</p>

			<p>
			A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying <span class="critic-quote">"The most 
			genuinely apian aspect of <em>Bee Movie</em> is that it spends a lot of its running time buzzing happily around,
			sniffing out fresh jokes wherever they may bloom."</span> Claudia Puig gave the film one and a half stars
			out of four, saying <span class="critic-quote">"<em>Bee Movie</em> is certainly not low-budget, but it has all the staying power and 
			creative value of a B-movie. The secret life of bees, as told by Seinfeld, is a bore with a capital 
			B."</span> Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three stars out of four, saying <span class="critic-quote">"Bee 
			Movie is not Shrek, and it is not Ratatouille either (by far the standout computer-animated feature of 
			the year). But it has enough buzzing wit and eye-popping animation to win over the kids—and probably 
			more than a few parents, too."</span> Richard Roeper gave the film a positive review, saying <span class="critic-quote">"This is a 
			beautifully animated, cleverly executed, warm and funny adventure."</span>

			<h2>Reception (continued)</h2>
			<p>
				Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, saying <span class="critic-quote">"All of this material, written by Seinfeld and 
				writers associated with his television series, tries hard, but never really takes off. We learn at the 
				outset of the movie that bees theoretically cannot fly. Unfortunately, in the movie, that applies only 
				to the screenplay. It is really, really, really hard to care much about a platonic romantic 
				relationship between Renee Zellweger and a bee, although if anyone could pull it off, she could."</span> 
				Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three out of four stars, saying <span class="critic-quote">"The vibe is loose-limbed and
				fluky, and the gags have an extra snap that's recognizably Seinfeldian. If I believed in a sitcom 
				afterlife, I'd swear the whole thing was cooked up by Kramer and George's dad."</span>

				<em>Bee Movie</em> led the 35th Annie Awards season with five nominations (including Best Animated Feature).
				At the 65th Golden Globe Awards, it was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film. The 13th 
				Critics' Choice Awards nominated the film for Best Animated Feature.
