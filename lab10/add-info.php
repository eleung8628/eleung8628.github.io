			<h1>Bee Movie</h1>
			<div class="subtitle">
				<p>
				<em>Bee Movie</em> is a 2007 American computer-animated comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation 
				and Columbus 81 Productions, and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film was directed 
				by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner (in the former's feature directorial debut) from a 
				screenplay by Jerry Seinfeld, Spike Feresten, Barry Marder and Andy Robin. It stars the 
				voices of Seinfeld, Renée Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, 
				and Chris Rock. The film centers on Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld), a honey bee who tries to 
				sue the human race for exploiting bees after learning from his new florist friend Vanessa 
				Bloome (Zellweger) that humans sell and consume honey.<br>
				<em>Bee Movie</em> debuted in New York City on October 25, 2007, and was released in theaters in the 
				United States on November 2. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its humor and 
				voice cast, but criticized its plot and lack of originality. The film was a box office success, 
				grossing $293.5 million worldwide on a budget of $150 million. It has since gathered a cult 
				following, partly driven by memes of the film shared on social media, which most often poke fun 
				at the film's premise, script and celebrity cameos.
