				<h1>Bee Movie</h1>
				<div class="subtitle">
					<p>
					<em>Bee Movie</em> is a 2007 American computer-animated comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation 
					and Columbus 81 Productions, and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film was directed 
					by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner (in the former's feature directorial debut) from a 
					screenplay by Jerry Seinfeld, Spike Feresten, Barry Marder and Andy Robin. It stars the 
					voices of Seinfeld, Ren√©e Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, 
					and Chris Rock. The film centers on Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld), a honey bee who tries to 
					sue the human race for exploiting bees after learning from his new florist friend Vanessa 
					Bloome (Zellweger) that humans sell and consume honey.<br>
					<em>Bee Movie</em> debuted in New York City on October 25, 2007, and was released in theaters in the 
					United States on November 2. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its humor and 
					voice cast, but criticized its plot and lack of originality. The film was a box office success, 
					grossing $293.5 million worldwide on a budget of $150 million. It has since gathered a cult 
					following, partly driven by memes of the film shared on social media, which most often poke fun 
					at the film's premise, script and celebrity cameos.

				<h2>Plot</h2>

				<img class="lead-img" src='images/poster.jpg' alt='poster'>

				<p>
				Barry B. Benson, an idealistic honey bee who has the ability to talk to humans, has recently graduated 
				from college and is about to enter the hive's Honex Industries honey-making workforce with his best 
				friend, Adam Flayman. Barry is initially excited to join the workforce, but his ambitious, 
				insubordinate attitude emerges upon discovering that his choice of job will never change once picked. 
				Later, the two bees run into a group of Pollen Jocks, bees who collect pollen from flowers outside the 
				hive, and they offer to take Barry with them if he is "bee enough". While on his first 
				pollen-gathering expedition in New York City, Barry gets lost in the rain, and ends up on the balcony 
				of a human florist named Vanessa Bloome. Upon noticing Barry, Vanessa's boyfriend Ken attempts to 
				squash him, but Vanessa gently catches and releases Barry outside the window, saving his life.
				</p>

				<p>
				Barry later returns to express his gratitude to Vanessa, breaking the sacred rule that bees are not to 
				communicate with humans. Barry and Vanessa develop a close friendship, bordering on attraction, and 
				spend time together. When he and Vanessa are in the grocery store, Barry discovers that the humans have
				been stealing and eating the bees' honey for centuries. He decides to journey to Honey Farms, which 
				supplies the grocery store with its honey. Incredulous at the poor treatment of the bees in the hive, 
				including the use of bee smokers to incapacitate the colony, Barry decides to sue the human race to 
				put an end to exploitation of the bees, with Vanessa agreeing to help.
				</p>

				<p>
				Barry's mission attracts wide attention from bees and humans alike, with countless spectators attending
					the trial. Although Barry is up against tough defense attorney Layton T. Montgomery, the trial's first 
				day goes well. That evening, Barry is having dinner with Vanessa when Ken shows up. Vanessa leaves the 
				room, and Ken expresses to Barry that he hates the pair spending time together. When Barry leaves to 
				use the restroom, Ken ambushes Barry and attempts to kill him, only for Vanessa to intervene and break 
				up with Ken. The second day at the trial, Montgomery unleashes an unrepentant character assassination 
				against the bees, leading a deeply offended Adam to sting him. Montgomery immediately exaggerates the 
				stinging to make himself seem the victim of an assault while simultaneously tarnishing Adam. Adam's 
				actions jeopardize the bees' credibility and his life, though he recovers. The third day, Barry wins 
				the trial by exposing the jury to the torturous treatment of bees, particularly use of the smoker, and 
				prevents humans from stealing honey from bees ever again. Having lost the trial, Montgomery cryptically
					warns Barry that a negative shift of nature is imminent.

				<h2>Plot (continued)</h2>
			
				<p>
				With Honex stopping honey production, every bee is put out of a job, including the vitally important 
				Pollen Jocks, resulting in all the world's flowers beginning to die out without any pollination. 
				Before long, the last remaining flowers on Earth are being stockpiled in Pasadena, California, intended
					for the last Tournament of Roses Parade. Barry and Vanessa travel to the parade and steal a float, 
				which they load into a plane. They hope to bring the flowers to the bees so they can re-pollinate the 
				world's last remaining flowers. When the plane's pilot and co-pilot both fall unconscious, Vanessa is 
				forced to land the plane, with help from Barry and the bees from Barry's hive.<br>
				Barry becomes a member of the Pollen Jocks, and they fly off to a flower patch. Armed with the pollen 
				of the last flowers, Barry and the Pollen Jocks reverse the damage and save the world's flowers, 
				restarting the bees' honey production. Later on, Barry runs a law firm at Vanessa's flower shop titled 
				"Insects at Law", which handles disputes between animals and humans. While selling flowers to 
				customers, Vanessa offers certain brands of honey that are "bee-approved".
