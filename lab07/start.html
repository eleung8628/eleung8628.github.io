		<h1>Bee Movie</h1>
		<div class="subtitle">
			<p>
			<em>Bee Movie</em> is a 2007 American computer-animated comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation 
			and Columbus 81 Productions, and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film was directed 
			by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner (in the former's feature directorial debut) from a 
			screenplay by Jerry Seinfeld, Spike Feresten, Barry Marder and Andy Robin. It stars the 
			voices of Seinfeld, Ren√©e Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, 
			and Chris Rock. The film centers on Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld), a honey bee who tries to 
			sue the human race for exploiting bees after learning from his new florist friend Vanessa 
			Bloome (Zellweger) that humans sell and consume honey.<br>
			<em>Bee Movie</em> debuted in New York City on October 25, 2007, and was released in theaters in the 
			United States on November 2. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its humor and 
			voice cast, but criticized its plot and lack of originality. The film was a box office success, 
			grossing $293.5 million worldwide on a budget of $150 million. It has since gathered a cult 
			following, partly driven by memes of the film shared on social media, which most often poke fun 
			at the film's premise, script and celebrity cameos.

		<h2>Plot</h2>

		<img class="lead-img" src='images/poster.jpg' alt='poster'>

		<p>
		Barry B. Benson, an idealistic honey bee who has the ability to talk to humans, has recently graduated 
		from college and is about to enter the hive's Honex Industries honey-making workforce with his best 
		friend, Adam Flayman. Barry is initially excited to join the workforce, but his ambitious, 
		insubordinate attitude emerges upon discovering that his choice of job will never change once picked. 
		Later, the two bees run into a group of Pollen Jocks, bees who collect pollen from flowers outside the 
		hive, and they offer to take Barry with them if he is "bee enough". While on his first 
		pollen-gathering expedition in New York City, Barry gets lost in the rain, and ends up on the balcony 
		of a human florist named Vanessa Bloome. Upon noticing Barry, Vanessa's boyfriend Ken attempts to 
		squash him, but Vanessa gently catches and releases Barry outside the window, saving his life.
		</p>

		<p>
		Barry later returns to express his gratitude to Vanessa, breaking the sacred rule that bees are not to 
		communicate with humans. Barry and Vanessa develop a close friendship, bordering on attraction, and 
		spend time together. When he and Vanessa are in the grocery store, Barry discovers that the humans have
		 been stealing and eating the bees' honey for centuries. He decides to journey to Honey Farms, which 
		supplies the grocery store with its honey. Incredulous at the poor treatment of the bees in the hive, 
		including the use of bee smokers to incapacitate the colony, Barry decides to sue the human race to 
		put an end to exploitation of the bees, with Vanessa agreeing to help.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Barry's mission attracts wide attention from bees and humans alike, with countless spectators attending
		 the trial. Although Barry is up against tough defense attorney Layton T. Montgomery, the trial's first 
		day goes well. That evening, Barry is having dinner with Vanessa when Ken shows up. Vanessa leaves the 
		room, and Ken expresses to Barry that he hates the pair spending time together. When Barry leaves to 
		use the restroom, Ken ambushes Barry and attempts to kill him, only for Vanessa to intervene and break 
		up with Ken. The second day at the trial, Montgomery unleashes an unrepentant character assassination 
		against the bees, leading a deeply offended Adam to sting him. Montgomery immediately exaggerates the 
		stinging to make himself seem the victim of an assault while simultaneously tarnishing Adam. Adam's 
		actions jeopardize the bees' credibility and his life, though he recovers. The third day, Barry wins 
		the trial by exposing the jury to the torturous treatment of bees, particularly use of the smoker, and 
		prevents humans from stealing honey from bees ever again. Having lost the trial, Montgomery cryptically
		 warns Barry that a negative shift of nature is imminent.
		</p>

		<p>
		With Honex stopping honey production, every bee is put out of a job, including the vitally important 
		Pollen Jocks, resulting in all the world's flowers beginning to die out without any pollination. 
		Before long, the last remaining flowers on Earth are being stockpiled in Pasadena, California, intended
		 for the last Tournament of Roses Parade. Barry and Vanessa travel to the parade and steal a float, 
		which they load into a plane. They hope to bring the flowers to the bees so they can re-pollinate the 
		world's last remaining flowers. When the plane's pilot and co-pilot both fall unconscious, Vanessa is 
		forced to land the plane, with help from Barry and the bees from Barry's hive.<br>
		Barry becomes a member of the Pollen Jocks, and they fly off to a flower patch. Armed with the pollen 
		of the last flowers, Barry and the Pollen Jocks reverse the damage and save the world's flowers, 
		restarting the bees' honey production. Later on, Barry runs a law firm at Vanessa's flower shop titled 
		"Insects at Law", which handles disputes between animals and humans. While selling flowers to 
		customers, Vanessa offers certain brands of honey that are "bee-approved".

		<h2>Production & Release</h2>

		<img src='images/seinfeld_bee.jpg' alt='seinfeld_bee_cast'>

		<p>
		The development of <em>Bee Movie</em> began when Steven Spielberg approached DreamWorks Animation CEO and 
		co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg after Jerry Seinfeld asked him to make an animated film featuring 
		insects. Production began in 2003. Seinfeld spent a week in Los Angeles working on it. Teleconferencing
		 system HP Halo was installed in Seinfeld's office in New York, enabling him to work on the film and 
		interact between coasts. Seinfeld said he set the film in New York because it was "the Tigris and 
		Euphrates of comedy", and Katzenberg was the main reason for making the film. The budget was 
		approximately $150 million. Spielberg was in two live-action trailers of this film in November 2006 
		and early 2007 where he interacted with Seinfeld, who wore a bee costume.

		website Rotten Tomatoes, with an <span class="stats">average rating of 5.6/10</span>. Its critical consensus reads, "<em>Bee Movie</em>

		</p>

		<p>
		Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "It's 
		on the easygoing level of Surf's Up, and a full tick up from, say, Over the Hedge or The Ant Bully. 
		But given the Seinfeld pedigree it's something of a disappointment." Peter Travers of Rolling 
		Stone gave the film three out of four stars, saying "At its relaxed best, when it's about, well, 
		nothing, the slyly comic <em>Bee Movie</em> is truly beguiling." Desson Thomson of The Washington Post said,
		 "<em>Bee Movie</em> feels phoned in on every level. The images, usually computer animation's biggest draw, are 
		disappointingly average. And as for the funny stuff, well, that's where you were supposed to come in."
		</p>

		<p>
		A. O. Scott of The New York Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying <span class="critic-quote">"The most 
		genuinely apian aspect of <em>Bee Movie</em> is that it spends a lot of its running time buzzing happily around,
		 sniffing out fresh jokes wherever they may bloom."</span> Claudia Puig gave the film one and a half stars
		 out of four, saying <span class="critic-quote">"<em>Bee Movie</em> is certainly not low-budget, but it has all the staying power and 
		creative value of a B-movie. The secret life of bees, as told by Seinfeld, is a bore with a capital 
		B."</span> Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three stars out of four, saying <span class="critic-quote">"Bee 
		Movie is not Shrek, and it is not Ratatouille either (by far the standout computer-animated feature of 
		the year). But it has enough buzzing wit and eye-popping animation to win over the kids‚Äîand probably 
		more than a few parents, too."</span> Richard Roeper gave the film a positive review, saying <span class="critic-quote">"This is a 
		beautifully animated, cleverly executed, warm and funny adventure."</span>
		</p>

		<p>
		Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, saying <span class="critic-quote">"All of this material, written by Seinfeld and 
		writers associated with his television series, tries hard, but never really takes off. We learn at the 
		outset of the movie that bees theoretically cannot fly. Unfortunately, in the movie, that applies only 
		to the screenplay. It is really, really, really hard to care much about a platonic romantic 
		relationship between Renee Zellweger and a bee, although if anyone could pull it off, she could."</span> 
		Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three out of four stars, saying <span class="critic-quote">"The vibe is loose-limbed and
		 fluky, and the gags have an extra snap that's recognizably Seinfeldian. If I believed in a sitcom 
		afterlife, I'd swear the whole thing was cooked up by Kramer and George's dad."</span>
		</p>

		<p>
		<em>Bee Movie</em> led the 35th Annie Awards season with five nominations (including Best Animated Feature).
		 At the 65th Golden Globe Awards, it was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film. The 13th 
		Critics' Choice Awards nominated the film for Best Animated Feature.
