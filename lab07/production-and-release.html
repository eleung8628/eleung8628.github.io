			<h1>Bee Movie</h1>
			<div class="subtitle">
				<p>
				<em>Bee Movie</em> is a 2007 American computer-animated comedy film produced by DreamWorks Animation 
				and Columbus 81 Productions, and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The film was directed 
				by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner (in the former's feature directorial debut) from a 
				screenplay by Jerry Seinfeld, Spike Feresten, Barry Marder and Andy Robin. It stars the 
				voices of Seinfeld, Ren√©e Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, 
				and Chris Rock. The film centers on Barry B. Benson (Seinfeld), a honey bee who tries to 
				sue the human race for exploiting bees after learning from his new florist friend Vanessa 
				Bloome (Zellweger) that humans sell and consume honey.<br>
				<em>Bee Movie</em> debuted in New York City on October 25, 2007, and was released in theaters in the 
				United States on November 2. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its humor and 
				voice cast, but criticized its plot and lack of originality. The film was a box office success, 
				grossing $293.5 million worldwide on a budget of $150 million. It has since gathered a cult 
				following, partly driven by memes of the film shared on social media, which most often poke fun 
				at the film's premise, script and celebrity cameos.

				<h2>Production & Release</h2>

				<p>
				The development of <em>Bee Movie</em> began when Steven Spielberg approached DreamWorks Animation CEO and 
				co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg after Jerry Seinfeld asked him to make an animated film featuring 
				insects. Production began in 2003. Seinfeld spent a week in Los Angeles working on it. Teleconferencing
				system HP Halo was installed in Seinfeld's office in New York, enabling him to work on the film and 
				interact between coasts. Seinfeld said he set the film in New York because it was "the Tigris and 
				Euphrates of comedy", and Katzenberg was the main reason for making the film. The budget was 
				approximately $150 million. Spielberg was in two live-action trailers of this film in November 2006 
				and early 2007 where he interacted with Seinfeld, who wore a bee costume.
