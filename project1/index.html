		<h1><em>Pokémon</em></h1>
		<div class="overview">
			<p>
				<em>Pokémon</em> is a Japanese media franchise consisting of video games, animated series and films, 
				a trading card game, and other related media. The franchise takes place in a shared universe in 
				which humans co-exist with creatures known as Pokémon, a large variety of species endowed with 
				special powers. The franchise's target audience is children aged 5 to 12, but it is known to 
				attract people of all ages.
			</p>

			<p>
				The franchise originated as a pair of role-playing games developed by <strong>Game Freak</strong>, following an 
				original concept by its founder, Satoshi Tajiri. Released on the Game Boy on February 27, 1996, 
				the games became sleeper hits and were followed by manga series, a trading card game, and anime 
				series and films. From 1998 to 2000, <em>Pokémon</em> was exported to the rest of the world, creating an 
				unprecedented global phenomenon dubbed "Pokémania". By 2002, the craze had ended, after which 
				<em>Pokémon</em> became a fixture in popular culture, with new products being released to this day. In 
				the summer of 2016, the franchise spawned a second craze with the release of <em>Pokémon Go</em>, an 
				augmented reality game developed by <strong>Niantic</strong>. <em>Pokémon</em> has since been estimated to be the world's 
				highest-grossing media franchise and one of the best-selling video game franchises.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<em>Pokémon</em> has an uncommon ownership structure. Unlike most IPs, which are owned by one company, 
				<em>Pokémon</em> is jointly owned by three: <strong>Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Game Freak</strong> 
				develops the core series role-playing games, which are published by Nintendo exclusively for 
				their consoles, while Creatures manages the trading card game and related merchandise, 
				occasionally developing spin-off titles. The three companies established <strong>The Pokémon Company 
				(TPC)</strong> in 1998 to manage the <em>Pokémon</em> property within Asia. The <em>Pokémon</em> anime series and films are 
				co-owned by <strong>Shogakukan</strong>. Since 2009, <strong>The Pokémon Company International (TPCi)</strong> subsidiary of TPC 
				has managed the franchise in all regions outside of Asia.

			<h2>Name</h2>
			<p>
				The contracted term Pokémon derives from a syllabic abbreviation of the franchise's full name, 
				Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター, Poketto Monsutā). When the franchise began to be released 
				internationally, the short form of the title was used, with an acute accent for pronunciation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Pokémon refers both to the franchise itself and the creatures within its fictional universe. 
				As a noun, it is identical in both the singular and plural, as is every individual species name;
				it is grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu" 
				and "many Pikachu". In English, Pokémon may be pronounced either poe-keh-mon or poe-key-mon.
			</p>

			<h2>General Concept</h2>
			<p>
				The <em>Pokémon</em> franchise is set in a world in which humans coexist with creatures known as Pokémon. 
				<em>Pokémon Red and Blue</em> introduced 151 Pokémon species, with new Pokémon being introduced in 
				subsequent games; as of February 2023, 1,015 Pokémon species have been introduced. Many Pokémon 
				are designed to resemble real-world animals; for example, Pikachu is a yellow mouse-like 
				Pokémon with a lightning bolt-shaped tail, and possesses electrical abilities.
			</p>

			<p>
				The player character takes the role of a Pokémon Trainer. The Trainer's three primary goals are 
				to explore the Pokémon world, complete their Pokédex―an electronic handheld encyclopedia―by 
				obtaining all available Pokémon, and to train a team of up to six Pokémon at a time and engage 
				them in battle. To obtain most Pokémon, the Trainer uses a spherical device known as a Poké 
				Ball. Once the opposing Pokémon is sufficiently weakened, the Trainer throws the Poké Ball 
				against it, and it is then transformed into a form of energy to be transported into the device. 
				Once the Pokémon is successfully caught, it is under the Trainer's command from then on. If the 
				Poké Ball is thrown again, the Pokémon re-materializes into its original state. The Trainer's 
				Pokémon can engage in battles against opposing Pokémon, including those in the wild or owned by 
				other Trainers. Because the franchise is aimed at children, these battles are never presented 
				as overtly violent and contain no blood or gore. Pokémon never die in battle, instead 
				fainting upon being defeated.
			</p>

			<p>
				After a Pokémon wins a battle, it gains experience and becomes stronger. After gaining a 
				certain amount of experience points, its level increases, as well as one or more of its 
				statistics. As its level increases, the Pokémon can learn new offensive and defensive moves to 
				use in battle. Many species of Pokémon can evolve into a different species, with 
				increased stats compared to its pre-evolved form. Most species will evolve at a certain 
				level, while others evolve through different means, such as exposure to a certain item.

				<h3>Trading Card Game</h3>
				<img src='images/pokemon_tcg.png' alt='tcg-img'>
				<p>
					<em>The Pokémon Trading Card Game</em>, abbreviated as PTCG or <em>Pokémon TCG</em>, is a collectible card 
					game developed by <strong>Creatures Inc.</strong> based on the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise. As of March 2023, the game 
					has sold over 52.9 billion cards worldwide.
				</p>

				<p>
					The <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game</em> is a strategy-based card game that is usually played on a 
					designated playmat or digitally on the official game client <em>Pokémon TCG Live </em>where two 
					players (assuming the role of Pokémon Trainer) use their Pokémon to battle one another. 
					Pokémon that have sustained enough damage from attacks that reaches or exceeds its HP is 
					referred to as being "Knocked Out," granting the opponent a prize card; however, powerful 
					card mechanics like Pokémon-V and Pokémon ex grant extra prize cards when Knocked Out.

				<h3>Anime</h3>
				<img src='images/pokemon_anime.png' alt='anime-img'>
				<p>
					<em>Pokémon the Series</em>, is a Japanese anime television series, part of <strong>The Pokémon Company's</strong> 
					<em>Pokémon</em> media franchise, which premiered on TV Tokyo in April 1997.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The anime franchise consists of eight sequential series in Japan, each based on a main 
					installment of the <em>Pokémon</em> video game series. In the international broadcasts, these series 
					are split across 26 seasons. The show originally followed Ash Ketchum, a young trainer of 
					fictional creatures called Pokémon. Joined by his partner Pokémon Pikachu and a rotating 
					cast of human characters, Ash goes on a journey to become a "Pokémon Master", traveling 
					through the various regions of the Pokémon world and competing in various Pokémon-battling 
					tournaments known as the Pokémon League. However, by the 26th season, a new cast is 
					featured, with brand new protagonists Liko and Roy.
				</p>

				<p>
					The <em>Pokémon</em> anime series was largely credited for allowing anime to become more popular and 
					familiar around the world, especially in the United States and Asia, where many Pokémon 
					films are among the highest-grossing anime films. It is also considered to be one of the 
					first anime series on television to reach this level of mainstream success with Western and 
					Asian audiences, as well as being credited with allowing the game series to reach such a 
					degree of popularity and vice versa. <em>Pokémon</em> is regarded as the most successful video game 
					adaptation of all time, with over 1,200 episodes broadcast and adapted for international 
					television markets, concurrently airing in 192 countries worldwide and one of the most 
					widely watched shows on Netflix, as of 2016.
